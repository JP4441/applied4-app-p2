# Application Tracker App

A simple app where people can keep track of their job applications:

- Add companies you're interested in, and information about them such as person of interest, questions to ask, note sent, when you applied for it, etc. If you applied less than 10 days ago the company button turns green, if between 10 and 20 days it turns yellow, and if your application is 20+ days old, it turns red.
- Keep all your important information in one place: skills, elevator pitch, personal statement, brand statement, etc.
